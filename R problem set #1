#The first specification model expalins around 80% of the variation in salary with significance of all the 
#independent variables. Dropping the LOGSALBEGIN which is significant in the model leads to a lower fitness quality 
#of the model and explanation of variation with R square dropping to 59%.

#The diagonal line in the the Q-Q gragh is an indication of the normality of the residuals. This is also supported
#by the Residuals vs fitted graph where must of the residuals are consirtrated around zero with a farily stright line 
#at zero with the existance of few outliers. A third test to check for normality which also concluds the same resuilt 
#is the Durbin-Watson test with a p-value of 0.018.
